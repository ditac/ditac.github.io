As a software engineer, my ability to code has been the most helpful. I've also been working on it constantly. When I'm on a brand new team, I always fall back on my coding/debugging skills. I have found that reading/writing code is an easy and satisfying way to understand the details of a system, even when I don't write a lot of code. Understanding the details helps me innovate from the ground up, which is a big confidence booster.

I consider effective coding skills to be -
    1.  You can read your teammates' code.
    2.  Ensure your code is easy to understand.
    3.  Bug-free code is key.
    4.  Fast, so you can experiment and learn.
    
What's the most effective way to write? Effective writing is all about clarity. You have to be clear about what you're trying to do and why. Sometimes you know what you want, but not how it will be implemented or even how it will look. A brand new project's structure will often need restructuring as you work out details you didn't think about up front. Once I have more clarity about the details, I always rewrite code for better structure and readability.

When you code, make sure it matches the style of your team and the people who're going to read it. It's really difficult for readers to follow you if you stray too far. Introduce new concepts gently and with enough introduction to get people to understand them. For example, I used to work on a team where everyone was new to Python. The team had a hard time understanding Python features like list comprehension and functional programming. After a few training sessions, I was able to get them on board with the concept and I was surprised by the rapid adoption.

Readability is also influenced by vocabulary. You can explain your thought process better on a brand-new project by doing code walk-throughs with your team. Code is much easier to understand and read once the basic structure and vocabulary are in place.
