description: RCA framework builds on Performance Analyzer to support root cause analysis (RCA) of performance and reliability problems for Elasticsearch instances. This framework would conduct real time root cause analysis of such problems using Performance Analyzer metrics. Root cause analysis can significantly improve operations, administration and provisioning of Elasticsearch clusters, and it can enable Elasticsearch client teams to tune their workloads to reduce errors.
