# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I enjoy working on large scale distributed systems and have primarily focused on cluster management, load balancing and performance of elastic cloud-native clusters. At AWS and Confluent, I have helped design, build, deploy, optimize and operate large scale search, stream processing and storage systems. I enjoy working on open source systems and am a committer on Open Distro for Elasticsearch. I have worked on numerous features and improvements around cross-region replication, replica placement, multi-az clusters and performance at Amazon Aurora, Amazon Elasticsearch Service and now Confluent Cloud.
